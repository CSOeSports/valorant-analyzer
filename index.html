    <title>Interactive VALORANT Agent Analyzer</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based SPA for optimal user navigation. 
        1. 'Meta Overview' (Default Tab): Presents high-level takeaways like role distribution and the ranked vs. pro meta split using summary charts and stat cards. This provides an immediate, digestible summary of the report's key findings.
        2. 'Agent Explorer': An interactive gallery of all agents. Users can filter by role and click an agent to view their detailed dossier (abilities, strengths, weaknesses) in a dedicated panel. This structure turns the report's long text sections into an on-demand reference tool, preventing information overload.
        3. 'Data Deep Dive': A section for data-focused users, featuring a sortable table of all agent stats and an interactive scatter plot. This allows for direct comparison and relationship analysis.
        This tabbed architecture was chosen to segment the vast amount of information into logical, user-driven sections, making the dense report much more accessible and explorable than a single, long scrolling page. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Role Distribution (Table 1) -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Donut Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Best for showing parts of a whole.
        - Ranked vs. Pro Meta (Sec 2.2) -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Directly compares pick rates for key agents, highlighting the meta divergence.
        - Agent Stats (Table 2) -> Goal: Organize/Compare -> Viz: Sortable HTML Table & Scatter Plot (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Click to sort, hover for details -> Justification: Table for precise lookups, scatter plot for visualizing relationships between Win/Pick rates.
        - Agent Sub-Roles (Sec 1) -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: Styled HTML/CSS Flexbox Diagram -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Clear, semantic way to show hierarchy without graphics.
        - Agent Dossiers (Part II) -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Dynamic Text Blocks & HTML Tables -> Interaction: Click agent card to display -> Justification: Presents detailed text content in a structured, on-demand format. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                        <p class="text-slate-400 mb-6">A key finding of the report is the stark difference between agent viability in ranked matchmaking versus coordinated professional play. Ranked favors self-sufficient agents who can win duels independently, while the pro scene elevates agents with deep strategic utility and team synergy. This chart highlights the pick rate disparity for some of the most telling examples.</p>
